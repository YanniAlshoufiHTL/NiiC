# Refactors 

## ALL HTTP Tests

Code duplication in every file from line 1 â€“ 4.

## ALL HTML

The CSS and JS should be split from HTML.

## /public/sites/calender.html: 

The source script tags are really confusing to be honest (IDK if we can do anything against that)
and the second thing is why do we have CSS code in the HTML file when we have a styles directory where every .html code
have a .css file but the code and the naming seems to be OK.

## /public/styles/plugin-store.css: 

There is no naming again the css code seems to be solid and yeah we do not care if it is responsive.

## /public/src/aetRequests_http

## /public/src/aetRequests_httpa/deleteAet_http:

Make a function `isStringANumber(str: String): bool`.

## /public/src/aetRequests_http/updateAet_http:

The fetch seems to be working well but I think you forgot to delete the alerts because why
should a user need an alert for the errors.
Change it to `console.error()`.

## /public/src/aet-prompt

### function promptTimeChange()

This function seems to be fine but there is two `do while` loops that do the same thing with
the same array at two positions but IDK if this is avoidable but everything else seems to be fine.

### function submitAetInputPrompt()

The function is too long => more complexity but no code duplication and I am OK with the namings.

## /public/src/calendar-dropping:

`els` => `elements`.

## /public/src/global-update-calendar

The function should be split into more functions

### ALL Routers

Expand `DatabaseService` and remove duplicate clients.
